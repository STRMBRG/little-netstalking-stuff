An easy and slightly faster way to launch programs

DeepScan.py

A simple IP range scanner written by OpenAI and a little bit by me

In ipranges.txt, set the ranges for scanning, each range on a new line

1. Enter ports to scan separated by commas (for example 80,443,21,22)

2. Enter the number of threads (The more the better, but the higher the load)

Active ips and ports will be written to workingips.txt

PortScan.py

From the name it is clear that this is a port scanner

1. Enter IP address for port scan

2. Enter the start port for scanning

3. Enter the destination port for scanning

4. Enter the delay (in seconds) between port checks (Adjust latency based on ping)

All open ports will be shown when the program finishes its work.
